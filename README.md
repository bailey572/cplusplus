# C++ (C Plus Plus)

Working examples of all things C++ for the learner

## Purpose

It is often interesting to bounce around languages, learn new concepts, and grow as a developer but at the same time, it is amazing on how much you forget of one language when you do.  This is my attempt to capture that which I know, refresh what I have forgotten, and learn what I do not know.

As I go forward, I will attempt to keep the below list updated by at least subject and leave public in the hopes that at some point it may be useful for someone else as well as myself.

* [GNU Tools Discussion](./GnuTools/GnuTools.md)
* [Simple Compile Walk through](./GnuTools/Compile.md)

## Warning

This is not meant to be a functional program nor do I expect it to be any more cohesive than a set of notes.  That being said, my hope is to create small meaningful code samples that are well documented for when I forget.  Hopefully, the source will have more comments than code and I will at least keep it ordered enough to easily find useful information.
